## AutoInvasionFinger
Are you tired of fingering the controller or keyboard 20 times to find an invasion just to get fog-walled or blended right back into doing the same, monotonous task until your madness meter maxes out? AutoInvasionFinger is a AHK 2.0 script that attempts to solve that problem by automating the invasion search so that you may find better things to do.

## How it Works
The script sends keystrokes without you having to actually press buttons or keys. An invasion may take up to 20 attempts of using the bloody finger or recursant finger. That is 180 + 200 button/key presses to invad 20 times using the bloody and recursant fingers, respectively assuming that the fingers are used from the multiplayer menu. That's approximately 2 minutes of doing the same thing just to either have a disconnect, fog-wall, or 30 second gank.

## PLEASE READ BEFORE USING
1. This script assumes that you have all Elden Ring mulitplayer items.
2. This script will use the invasion fingers in the multiplayer menu and nowhere else.
3. You must have AutoHotkey 2.0 installed to be able to run AutoHotkey scripts.
4. This script has only been tested using Windows 11. Unexpected behavior may occur if this script is used with a different operating system.

## Installation
1. Download AutoHotkey 2.0. This allows AutoHotkey scripts to be created and executed.
2. Download the AutoHotkey script from this repository and place it anywhere in your file system. 

## How to Use
1. Run Elden Ring and have your character ready to invade.
2. Double click on the script to run it.
3. Press lowercase I to start auto invading.
4. Press lowercase L to stop the invasion loop once a successful invasion is found. Otherwise keystrokes will continue to be sent which may result in unexpected behavior.
5. Press lowercase Y to terminate the script.
